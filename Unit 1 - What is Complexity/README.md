## WHAT IS IT?

Very simple model of ant foraging mostly just learning the extreme basics of the NetLogo modeling environment.

It was completed as part of the coursework for the "Introduction to Complexity" class held by Complexity Explorer ( https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/119-introduction-to-complexity ) Unit 1 "What is Complexity?".

## HOW IT WORKS

The nine center patches form the ant nest. Ants wander around, and when an ant finds a patch of food it collects it and returns to the nest before it wanders out again. When returning to the nest, the ant leaves a pheromone trail (that is, the patches that it traverses each gain a unit of pheromone). The pheromone evaporates over time (that is, at every time step each patch with pheromone has a probability of losing its pheromone). If a wandering ant encounters a patch with pheromone, it follows the trail as long as it can sense pheromone.

## HOW TO USE IT

Sliders:
`population` - the number of ants in the model
`max-step-size` - each ant my only move a random integer distance between zero (inclusive) and this amount (exclusive) at every tick
`max-turn-angle` - when the ant is foraging for food and does not sense a pheromone trail, this is the maximum angle that it will turn left or right in its wanderings
`evaporation-chance` - the percentage chance each tick that a unit of pheromone will "evaporate" from a patch

Buttons:
`Setup` - resets the model world
`GoüîÅ` - runs the model

## THINGS TO TRY

How does changing the parameters affect how long it takes before the ants find all of the food?
