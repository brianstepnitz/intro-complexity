# My "Introduction to Complexity" coursework

My homework for the Complexity Explorer "Introduction to Complexity" online course (<https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/119-introduction-to-complexity>).

## Description

Introductory and educational models to learn about complexity and systems science.

Each model has more information specific to it in its "Info" tab when you open it in NetLogo.

## Getting Started

These models require the [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) modeling environment.

Many of them may be able to be run in [NetLogo Web](https://netlogoweb.org/) but they were not specifically developed with that in mind and so no guarantee is made that they will work there.
